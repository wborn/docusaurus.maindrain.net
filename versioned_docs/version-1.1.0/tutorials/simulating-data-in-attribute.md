# Simulating data in attribute

If you don't have a data connection running yet or want to simulate the behaviour of an attribute, you can use the Simulator Agent to replay data. To do that, take the following steps:
1. Add the 'Simulator Agent' to your system.
2. Add the configuration 'Agent link' to the attribute you want to replay data for.
3. Select the 'SimulatorAgentLink'.

4. Open the 'Replay data' JSON for this attribute and add a number and the related timestamps (seconds) for a 24hr time period.

5. You will now see the attribute replaying the filled in data.
